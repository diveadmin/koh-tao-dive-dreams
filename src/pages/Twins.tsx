      detailedDescription="Twins Pinnacle is possibly the most popular dive site on Koh Tao and is perfectly designed for recreational scuba diving and PADI training courses. The site features three distinct pinnacles: two large collections of coral-covered boulders and a smaller deeper group of rocks further west, creating an east-west axis that is easy to navigate. The name likely derives from either the two main rock pinnacles underwater or the two peaks of Koh Nang Yuan island that overlook this wonderful dive site. With its sheltered position and relative protection from monsoon weather, Twins always provides excellent diving conditions and thriving marine life. The site is renowned for its macro action and diverse reef fish species, making it ideal for photography, identification courses, and buoyancy practice."
